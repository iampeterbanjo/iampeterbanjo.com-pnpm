There are a number of ways to learn machine learning on [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) but my favourite is using [Qwik labs](https://www.qwiklabs.com). What's great about it is that each lab has a preconfigured environment that includes all the essential permissions and setup.

I've tried using the cloud services of [Open Shift](https://www.openshift.com/products), [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com), [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson) and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) and I found that getting the service working with the right options is a major source of confusion. I found AWS to be the hardest - their fine granularity of rules and privileges felt tedious. Qwik labs include a user login with the right permissions to complete the lab [step-by-step](https://support.google.com/qwiklabs/answer/9115366?hl=en&ref_topic=9114857). This means that I could realistically commit an hour to learning the basics of the Machine learning.

Qwik labs has [pay-as-you-go or subscription pricing](https://support.google.com/qwiklabs/answer/9120902?hl=en&ref_topic=9120803) but I managed to get some free credits for attending the [Google Devfest on air 2018](https://devfest.withgoogle.com/events/devfestonair18). And I'm glad I did.
